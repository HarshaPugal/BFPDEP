# BFPDEP(Bit vector based Frequent Pattern mining using Discarded Elements Prudently)
BFPDEP (Bit vector based Frequent Pattern mining using Discarded Elements Prudently) is an algorithm that enhances frequent itemset mining through the use of bitwise operations. It effectively categorizes elements into two groups—actual and discarded—minimizing redundancy in the dataset. The algorithm begins by converting itemsets into bit vectors, which accelerates operations. Subsequently, it selectively reintegrates discarded elements to uncover meaningful patterns. By implementing a minimum support threshold, the algorithm prunes infrequent elements, boosting computational efficiency while preserving important frequent patterns.
